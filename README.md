# Abstract

Terpene synthases (TPS) are a key family of enzymes responsible for generating the diverse terpene scaffolds that underpin natural products, including front-line anticancer drugs such as Taxol. However, de novo TPS design through directed evolution is costly and slow. We introduce TpsGPT, a generative AI framework for scalable TPS protein design, built by fine-tuning the protein language model ProtGPT2 on 79,000 TPS sequences mined from UniParc. TpsGPT generates de novo enzyme candidates in silico and evaluates them with multiple orthogonal validation metrics, including EnzymeExplorer classification, structural confidence (pLDDT), sequence diversity, CLEAN classification, InterPro domain detection and Foldseek structure alignment. From an initial pool of 28,000 generated sequences, we identified seven putative de novo TPS enzymes that satisfy all validation criteria. Experimental validation confirm potential TPS enzymatic activity in two of the generated sequences. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned protein language models can effectively explore the vast protein sequence space and yield functional enzyme candidates, providing a scalable alternative to traditional experimental approaches.
